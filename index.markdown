# Welcome to The Litterbox
Founded in 1996 by [Kelly Sosik-Hamor][kelly-sosik-hamor] and [Sean Sosik-Hamor][sean-sosik-hamor], The Litterbox was originally created to raise awareness about no-kill animal shelters in Carbon County, Pennsylvania. The website originally included a searchable database of pets available for adoption, showcased shelter-friendly veterinarians, and included various pet-care articles.

The Litterbox shut down as an animal rescue resource in the early 2000s once websites like Petfinder started to grow their national network. For now, The Litterbox exists as an email-only domain name, but may eventually grow again into an animal-rescue resource.
